This project implements a Multilingual Transformer Model for translating English sentences into two target languages: Hindi and Telugu. The model is built from scratch using PyTorch and trained on a custom multilingual dataset, demonstrating the capability of transformers for multilingual sequence-to-sequence tasks.
